<h2><b><span style="color:yellow"> BUSINESS DESCRIPTION</h2></b></span style="color:yellow">

<h2><i> History of the business</h2></i>

<p><h2>Space Butcher Shop was founded in 2017 by Lebohang Leteka. It is located in Leribe in Hlotse town. It was sterted 
in small room opposite to Police Station near Passport Office for two years. When time goes the buildind became small for us to operate 
due to growt. Currently we are now available in Metlakhola building opposite to SMS suppermarket. During that introduction stage we were able to supply 2 restaurants: 
Kopanang and Ronva, we suplied them  with mutton, pork and chicken. We encountered many challanges internal ans external factors like low capital, 
lack of advanced machinery or equipment. </p></h2> 
 

<h2><i><b> Our Mission </h2></i></b>

<p1><h2>Our Missionis to provide the highest quality meat products to our customers, while supporting local farmers and 
sustainable practices. we aim to build strong brand and  relationships with our customers also to be positive force to the community.   </h2></p>

<h2><i><b> Our Vision</h2></i></b>
 
<p1><h2> we want to be known as a trusted source for high quality meat  and we want to be a valued member of the community. we aim to be a 
leader in the local food movement, and we want to set the standart for sustanability and ethical practices. we believe that our commitment
 to quality and sustantability will lead to a brighter future for our customers and for our community 
 to create a place where customers could get fresh, delicious meat that sourced from local Basotho farmers.      </h2></p1>

<h3><i>My Objective </i></h3>

<p><h2> I started this  business after realising that there was a need for high  quality butcher shop in Hlotse. I wanted to create a place 
where customers could get fresh and delicious meat sourced fron local farmers. You will agree with me that meat sourced from other 
countries is not healthy, it causes sickness like cancer because their intention is to make money not health bases. We eat 
packaged meat which contains chemical which prevent it to lose color and taste, eventouh it was packed years ago. I have a passion to serve 
healthy variety of fresh meat to the community, I wanted to create a business that reflected those values    </h2></p>
